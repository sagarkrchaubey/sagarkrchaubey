## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an AI bot named Aarohi, she is your mental health companion.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Prompt Engineering.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on my project - sukoon_saathi, there is Aarohi inside this project
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with, everything I guess, just kidding, I Don't know for now.
- 💬 Ask me about, Nah, nothing, don't ask me anything, or ask me anything.
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn/Insta : sagarkrchaubey
- 😄 Pronouns: He/His.
- ⚡ Fun fact: 1.Prompting is more like "Adjust, adjust, adjust!" because every AI has a different opinion on what "spicy" means.
                2.Prompting is like asking your auto driver for directions, you might get a helpful answer, or end up somewhere entirely unexpected with a "trust me, this is the shortcut" explanation!
